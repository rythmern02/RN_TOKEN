**Smart Contract README: MyToken**

---

**Introduction:**
MyToken is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token smart contract that allows for the creation, distribution, and management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This README provides an overview of the contract's functionalities and usage.

**Token Details:**
- **Token Name:** RYTHMASTIC
- **Token Abbreviation:** RN

**Features:**
1. **Token Minting:** Allows the creation of new tokens and adds them to the total token supply.
2. **Token Burning:** Enables the destruction of tokens, reducing the total token supply.

**Usage:**
1. **Token Deployment:**
   - Deploy the `MyToken` smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
2. **Token Minting:**
   - Call the `mint` function with the desired Ethereum address and the amount of tokens to mint.
3. **Token Burning:**
   - Call the `burn` function with the Ethereum address from which tokens will be burned and the amount of tokens to burn.

**Security Considerations:**
- Ensure that only authorized entities have access to the `mint` and `burn` functions to prevent unauthorized creation or destruction of tokens.
- Implement appropriate access control mechanisms to restrict access to critical functions.

**License:**
- This smart contract is open-source and available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
